# Solution Templates

Solution Templates provide cookbook Data Hub examples with walkthroughs to accerate you in development of your data hub for your use case.

These can be used with [Data Hub Central][dhc] or [Data Hub Central Community Edition][dhcce] (DHCCE).  The walkthroughs provided currently document how to get started using DHCCE.

Our goal is that a template consists of 3 major components:
* A 360 model for a common use case
* Sample flows and steps for loading data and mapping it to that model
* Outputs for delivery off the integrated data in the form of Explore validation in DHCCE as well as BI Reports

Not all walkthroughs provide reports at this time, but providing them with each template remains a goal.

## Use Cases
* HR360

## Using a Template
Each directory contains a README for getting started along with
* A Walkthrough
* Sample Data Hub Project
* Any additional Reports

You can use gradle to quick deploy and undeploy different use cases and explore the walkthroughs.

## Want to Contribute?
